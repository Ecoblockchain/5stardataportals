# [5 stars of Open Data Portals](http://pieter.pm/5stardataportals/)

A website gathering examples for the 5 stars of Open Data Portals

## The 5 stars

### ★ A dataset registry

A list of links towards datasets that are openly licensed

### ★★ A metadata provider

Make sure the authentic sources inside your organisation are adding the right metadata fields (e.g., according to [dcat](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/)). This list of datasets should in its turn be licensed openly, so that other portals can aggregate or cherrypick datasets.

### ★★★ A cocreation platform

On the platform, support a conversation about your data. 

### ★★★★ A data provider

Make sure the resources inside your organisation are given a unique identifier (preferably URIs) and that your platform acts as the access point for the data itself, not only its metadata.

### ★★★★★ A common datahub

Make sure you manage the datasets in an open world and free them from the silo that is your organization.

For example, having URIs for things and concepts in your organization, which everyone may publish statements about on The Web.
